## Django

#### Setting up Virtual Enivronment
1. Creating the virtual env   
	`$ python3 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/djangodev`
2. Activating the virtual environment  

	```$ source ~/.virtualenvs/djangodev/bin/activate```
	- Everytime we open a new terminal we have to activate the virtual environment.

#### Project

1. Creating a project

	`$ django-admin startproject <project_name>`
    - This will initialize setup for the project.
    - Provides us autogenerated code that establishes a Django Project.

2. Development Server

	`$ python manage.py runserver <ip-address>:<portno>`
    - Go to your project directory and run this command
    - It will run the Django Development Server(a lightweight Web server written purely in python)
    - Only for development phase not for production
    - To quickly develop apps without setting up production server
	- Default <ip-address>: 127.0.0.1
	- Default <port-no>: 8000
	-
